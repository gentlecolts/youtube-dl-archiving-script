for each channel/playlist/whatever you want to rip:
-make a copy of the template folder named whatever you want
-add the url to that folder's url.txt, the single url should be the only thing in url.txt unless you want multiple channels to share the same folder for whatever reason
-run rip.sh from that folder

to update:
-either cd to the given folder and run update.sh or just run updateAll.sh from anywhere
